# Twitter Privacy Policy Diff

No one likes reading privacy policies. They are always long and the legal-speak is hard to wrap your head around.
I got an email from Twitter that they were updating their Privacy Policy, so I decided to actually make an attempt to see what changes were made.

After opening the page, I got too lazy and decided to 'git diff' the policy.
You can view the gif diff [here](https://batraman.github.io/twitter-privacy-policy-diff)

This is an experiment to see how communicating Privacy Policy changes can be improved.
Right now, the popular way is to write a blog post summarizing the changes like [this one](http://support.twitter.com/articles/20174594) and encouraging "...you to read the updated policy in full" (lol)

Companion blog post highlighting the things I learned: [git diff: Twitter's Privacy Policy](http://sarthakbatra.com/blog/git-diff-twitter/)

P.S. This repo (hopefully) satisfies the fair-use policy to use the content that Twitter owns for the purpoes of analysis and commentary.
